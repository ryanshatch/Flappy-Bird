  <h1 align="center">Flappy Bird Game</h1>

  <h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>
  <p align="center">
    Flappy Bird is a simple, addictive side-scrolling game where the player controls a bird and tries to navigate it through a
    series of pipes without colliding with them. The game keeps track of the player's score based on how many pipes they
    successfully pass through.
